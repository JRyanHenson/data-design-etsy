		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong>Sally Seller</p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong>32</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong>Windows moderate user. Sally uses Dell Inspiron 3000 series, and an iPhone 6 with a limited data plan. </p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>Sally is intelligent, creative, and meticulous but not a power computer user. She can learn quickly but can be overwhelmed when tasks become too technical. She has a full-time job and one child so her free time is limited</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong>While by day Sally is a senior Geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, her true passion is making Elvis paper mache dolls. She needs a user friendly site where she can easily sell her art. Sally is a good fit for Crapsy because she needs an easy to use platform for displaying and selling her art.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong>Sally's goal is be a full time artisan and eventually move from paper mache Elvis's to paintings of Marilyn Monroe on velvet backgrounds.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story:</strong>As a user, Sally needs to easily set up a Crapsy account, upload a description and picture of my product and sell it quickly</p>
